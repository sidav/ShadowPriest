### cx_freeze (recommended, works at 24.07.2018): ###
1. 'pip3 install cx_freeze'
2. 'python setup.py build'
3. The exe will be in /build/some_folder_name. Don't forget to copy the font there!



### PYINSTALLER (deprecated): ###

First, install the packages: ``tdl``, ``libtcod-cffi``, and ``PyInstaller``.
!!! AFAIK PyInstaller should be the dev version to support python 3.6!!!
!!! dev version of it is installed via "pip install https://github.com/pyinstaller/pyinstaller/archive/develop.zip" !!!

On Windows you must also install the ``pywin32`` package
(named ``pypiwin32`` if you're using pip install.)

Then run the PyInstaller script with this command::

    PyInstaller ShadowPriest.py --additional-hooks-dir=.

The finished build will be placed at ``dist/hello_world``.

You can also build to one file with the command (RECOMMENDED)::

    PyInstaller ShadowPriest.py --additional-hooks-dir=. -F

DON'T FORGET TO INCLUDE THE png FONT TO THE RESULTING DIST FOLDER!
