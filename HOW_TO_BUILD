First, install the packages: ``tdl``, ``libtcod-cffi``, and ``PyInstaller``.
!!!PyInstaller should be the dev version to support python 3.6!!!
!!! dev version is installed via "pip install https://github.com/pyinstaller/pyinstaller/archive/develop.zip" !!!

On Windows you must also install the ``pywin32`` package
(named ``pypiwin32`` if you're using pip install.)

Then run the PyInstaller script with this command::

    PyInstaller main.py --additional-hooks-dir=.

The finished build will be placed at ``dist/hello_world``.

You can also build to one file with the command (RECOMMENDED)::

    PyInstaller main.py --additional-hooks-dir=. -F

DON'T FORGET TO INCLUDE THE png FONT TO DIST FOLDER
